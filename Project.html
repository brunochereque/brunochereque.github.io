        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

        <h2> How have the patterns of mental health disorders evolved in the UK over the past decade,

                <h2> Project aim</h2>

                <p>The aim of this project is to investigate historical and regional patterns in depression across the UK, focusing on historial and regional trends in prevalence, and service utilization. By examining data from the Fingertips API, I seek to uncover key insights into how mental health outcomes vary over time and by region, and how socioeconomic factors such as deprivation contribute to these disparities.
            </p>
                <p>The analysis begins with a comprehensive look at the historical trends in depression prevalence over the past decade to establish context. Next, regional disparities are mapped to highlight areas with disproportionately high or low rates of mental health disorders. Building on this, the project explores the correlation between mental health outcomes and deprivation levels to identify socioeconomic drivers of mental health issues.
            </p>
                <p>To further understand service access, the project compares mental health service utilization rates (e.g., IAPT referrals) against regional mental health prevalence. Finally, a comparison of estimated versus diagnosed cases sheds light on potential underreporting and barriers to mental health care in certain regions.
            </p>
                <p> This research aims to inform policymakers and stakeholders about critical gaps in mental health services and areas requiring targeted intervention to improve public health outcomes.
